Loan Simulator Application


Project Description (4-5 sentences)
This application will enable the customer to simulate whether his/her potential loan applications are likely to get approved or disapproved. The user will have to type in a few questions that the application is asking, and based on the information, he/she will be assigned the application result. If the application is approved, then the user will be provided the interest rates, the possible loan amount, the approved loan period, and the credit grade. After this, the user can also run a simulator which displays the remaining principal and interests.
